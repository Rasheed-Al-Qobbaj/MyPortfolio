# MyPortfolio

This repository contains a portfolio project that I created to experiment with different technologies for building a personal portfolio or CV application.

## Technologies

I'm exploring three different technologies for this project:

1. .NET (C# with Windows Forms & WPF)
2. Tkinter (Python)
3. Electron (JavaScript/HTML/CSS)

## Project Overview

Each technology is implemented in a separate folder within this repository. You can explore each folder to see the source code, documentation, and the final application.

## Goals

The main goals of this project are:

- Evaluate the ease of use and development speed of each technology.
- Assess the flexibility and capabilities of each technology for building a portfolio/CV application.
- Compare the visual design and user experience of the applications created with each technology.

## Difficulties

While working on this project, I've encountered several challenges:

1. **Limited Knowledge of UI/UX Design:** As a developer, I have little to no knowledge about what constitutes good UI/UX design. Creating visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces is a new and exciting learning curve for me.

2. **Lack of Set Information for My Portfolio:** As I develop my portfolio, I'm facing the challenge of not having a clear structure or set information to include. Deciding on the content, layout, and how to best present my work is a work in progress.

3. **Hardware Setbacks:** Recently, both my PC and laptop experienced technical issues on the same day, leading to significant disruptions. Rebuilding my development environment and ensuring everything is back to its optimal state has become an additional task I must address.

These difficulties are part of the learning and development process, and I'm committed to overcoming them as I progress in this project.


## How to Run
