# MyPortfolio

This repository contains a portfolio project that I created to experiment with different technologies for building a personal portfolio or CV application.

## Technologies

I'm exploring three different technologies for this project:

1. **.NET (C# with Windows Forms & WPF)
2. **Tkinter (Python)
3. **Electron (JavaScript/HTML/CSS)

## Project Overview

Each technology is implemented in a separate folder within this repository. You can explore each folder to see the source code, documentation, and the final application.

## Goals

The main goals of this project are:

- Evaluate the ease of use and development speed of each technology.
- Assess the flexibility and capabilities of each technology for building a portfolio/CV application.
- Compare the visual design and user experience of the applications created with each technology.

## How to Run

Feel free to explore the project and provide feedback or suggestions. I'm excited to see the results of this experiment and share them with the community!
